      This is not a building permit. Until we issue a permit to you, you cannot start work, change the property's occupancy, or change its use. (See the San Francisco Building Code and San Francisco Housing Code.)

      Once we issue a building permit, you must post it at the job. The owner will also be responsible for keeping the approved plans and permit application at the property.

      No one can occupy your ADU until you either:

      - Have a certificate of final completion posted on the building

      - Receive a permit of occupancy from us

An agent of the owner cannot execute this notice unless you, the property owner, obtain the prior approval of the permitting authority.

    label: About unlicensed workers
    level: 5

  - type: paragraph
    label: |
      Unlicensed workers often tell property owners to apply for an "Owner-Builder" building permit. When you state you are the owner and the builder, you imply you are providing your own labor and materials. This makes you the responsible party of record on the permit.

      If you work with anyone other than California licensed Contractors on this project, and it costs $500 or more (including labor and materials), you may be considered as an "employer" under state and federal law.

      "Employers" must:

      - Register with the state and federal government

      - Withhold payroll taxes

      - Provide worker's compensation disability insurance

      - Contribute to unemployment compensation for each employee

      If you fail to follow these laws, you may be exposing yourself to serious financial risk.

      If you lose money after contracting an unlicensed worker and file a complaint, the Contractors’ State License Board might not be able to help you. Your only remedy against unlicensed Contractors may be in civil court.

      If an unlicensed worker or their employees are injured while working on your property, you may be held liable for damages. Homeowner's insurance may not provide coverage for these injuries.

  - type: header
    level: 5
    label: Protecting yourself

  - type: paragraph
    label: |
      You can prevent this risk by hiring a licensed Contractor, and filing the permit in their name instead.

      Licensed contractors are regulated by laws designed to protect the public. The law requires contractors to have California licenses and bonds. Contractors must also write their license numbers on permits and contracts.

      After receiving an Owner-Builder permit, you may want to hire Contractors afterwards. If this happens, you will need to verify whether they have:

      - Licenses

      - Active workers' compensation insurance coverage

      **Website:** [www.cslb.ca.gov](www.cslb.ca.gov).

      **If you are an Owner-Builder**

      Under California Contractors' State License Law, it is illegal to build a single-family residential structure with the intent to sell it, unless you:

      - Contract a licensed general building Contractor for all work

      - Hire licensed subcontractors for 4 structures or less in a calendar year

      If you sell the property listed on this permit, and there are latent defects in the workmanship or materials, you may be held liable for the financial or personal injuries any future owner(s) sustain.
